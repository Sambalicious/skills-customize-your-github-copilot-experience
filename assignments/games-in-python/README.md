# 📘 Assignment: Games in Python

## 🎯 Objective

Students will create interactive Python games to practice string manipulation, loops, conditionals, and user input while building engaging applications that demonstrate fundamental programming concepts.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Hangman Game

#### Description
Build the classic word-guessing game where players guess letters to reveal a hidden word before running out of attempts. This task will help you practice string manipulation, loops, and conditionals in an engaging way.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Randomly select words from a predefined list of at least 10 words
- Display the word as underscores (e.g., "_ _ _ _ _") initially
- Accept single letter guesses from the player
- Update the display to show correctly guessed letters in their positions
- Track and display the number of incorrect guesses remaining
- End the game when the word is fully guessed (win) or attempts are exhausted (lose)
- Display appropriate win/lose messages with the correct word revealed
- Handle invalid input gracefully (non-letters, repeated guesses)

### 🛠️ Number Guessing Game

#### Description
Create a number guessing game where the computer selects a random number and the player tries to guess it with hints provided after each attempt.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Generate a random number between 1 and 100
- Allow the player to input guesses
- Provide "too high" or "too low" feedback after each guess
- Count and display the number of attempts taken
- End the game when the correct number is guessed
- Display a congratulatory message with the number of attempts
- Ask if the player wants to play again
