# 📘 Assignment: Java Fundamentals

## 🎯 Objective

Students will learn the fundamentals of Java programming by creating object-oriented programs that demonstrate core concepts including classes, methods, data types, and control structures while building practical applications.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Student Grade Calculator

#### Description
Create a Java program that manages student grades using object-oriented programming principles. You'll build a Student class and a GradeCalculator class to handle grade calculations and display student information.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Create a `Student` class with private fields for name, student ID, and an array of grades
- Include constructor, getter, and setter methods in the Student class
- Implement methods to add grades, calculate average, and determine letter grade
- Create a `GradeCalculator` class with a main method to test the Student class
- Handle at least 5 different students with multiple grades each
- Display formatted output showing student name, ID, average grade, and letter grade
- Include proper error handling for invalid grades (outside 0-100 range)

### 🛠️ Simple Banking System

#### Description
Build a basic banking system that demonstrates encapsulation and method overloading. Create classes to represent bank accounts and perform common banking operations.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Create a `BankAccount` class with private fields for account number, account holder name, and balance
- Implement constructor methods and appropriate getter/setter methods
- Include methods for deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry
- Implement method overloading for deposit (accept different parameter types)
- Create a `Bank` class to manage multiple accounts
- Handle insufficient funds scenarios with appropriate error messages
- Display formatted account statements
- Demonstrate the creation and manipulation of at least 3 different accounts
